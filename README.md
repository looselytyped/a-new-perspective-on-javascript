# A New Perspective on JavaScript

This is a [presentation](https://www.apexsystems.com/event/toolbox-talk/new-perspective-javascript) I gave for Apex Systems in May.
It is heavily inspired by a presentation I saw by Evan You, the creator of [Vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org/), on building a simple reactivity system using modern JavaScript features.

This talk introduces several new features of JavaScript, including [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), [Private class features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields), [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)s, [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)s and [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)s.

Please see Notes.md for a step-by-step description and any issues/caveats to our solution.
